# Blog - A Complete Guide into All PCB Manufacturing Materials

The purpose of this blog post is to provide a comprehensive guide on the materials used in PCB manufacturing.

1. We will begin by describing the PCB manufacturing steps involved in the creation of multilayer boards.
2. Then, we will outline all the materials involved in the process.
3. Finally, we will provide a description and purpose of the materials throughout the different steps.

## Manufacturing Process Steps

The purpose of the PCB manufacturing process is to convert **PCB designs** into **physical PCB boards**.

Manufacturing is a long, meticulous and detailed process with numerous steps.

The steps, in overview, are outlined as the following:

1. Preparation
    - At the end of the PCB design process, file generation is conducted to produce the files needed in the fabrication of the boards. Files of interest include Gerber files, drilling files and documentation files.
2. Inner-Layer Processing:
    - Process inner layers of the PCB, including lamination, drilling, electroplating, imaging, and etching.
3. Outer-Layer Processing:
    - Repeat the processing steps for outer layers of the PCB.
4. Solder Mask Application:
    - Apply solder mask to insulate and protect the PCB surface.
5. Surface Finish:
    - Apply surface finish to improve solderability and reliability.
6. Silkscreen:
    - Apply silkscreen markings and identifiers onto the PCB surface.
7. Testing and Packaging:
    - Perform electrical testing and prepare PCBs for assembly.
8. Profiling and V-Scoring:
    - Cut PCBs into individual units using profiling and v-scoring techniques.
9. Assembly:
    - Populate PCBs with electronic components through the PCB assembly process.

## PCB Manufacturing Materials - In Detail

### Fiberglass

Fiberglass, specifically fiberglass cloth, serves as the substrate or base material for PCBs. It provides mechanical support and insulation between copper layers. Fiberglass cloth is known for its high strength, durability, and excellent electrical properties, making it a popular choice in PCB manufacturing.

### Copper Foil

Copper foil is used to create conductive pathways on the PCB surface through a process called etching. It is laminated onto the substrate and selectively etched away to form the desired circuit pattern. Copper foil is preferred for its high conductivity and ability to adhere well to the substrate.

### Resin

Resin, often referred to as epoxy resin, is used as a bonding agent to laminate layers of fiberglass cloth together. It also serves as a protective coating for the PCB, enhancing its mechanical strength and resistance to environmental factors such as moisture and heat.

### Photomask

A photomask is a patterned transparent film used in the imaging process of PCB fabrication. It contains the circuit design information and acts as a stencil for transferring the design onto the PCB substrate through exposure to UV light.

### Photoresist

Photoresist is a light-sensitive material applied to the surface of the copper foil. It undergoes chemical changes when exposed to UV light through the photomask, allowing for the selective removal of unwanted copper during the etching process.

### Prepreg

Prepreg, short for pre-impregnated resin, is a fiberglass cloth pre-impregnated with uncured resin. It is used to bond together multiple layers of copper-clad laminate during the lamination process, forming a solid PCB substrate with defined electrical properties.

### Solder Mask

Solder mask is a protective layer applied to the surface of the PCB to insulate copper traces and pads from environmental contaminants and prevent unintended solder bridges during assembly. It also enhances the PCB's durability and solderability.

### Silkscreen

Silkscreen is a printing process used to apply identification markings, component outlines, and other visual indicators onto the surface of the PCB. It helps with component placement and assembly, as well as providing important information such as part numbers and logos.

### Surface Finish

Surface finish refers to the final coating applied to the exposed copper surfaces of the PCB to improve solderability, corrosion resistance, and overall reliability. Common surface finishes include HASL (Hot Air Solder Leveling), ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold), and OSP (Organic Solderability Preservative).

## Manufacturing Processes in PCB Fabrication

### Lamination

Lamination involves bonding together multiple layers of substrate, copper foil, and prepreg using heat and pressure to form a rigid composite structure.

### Drilling

Drilling is the process of creating holes or vias in the PCB for component placement and electrical connections. High-precision drills are used to accurately position holes according to the circuit design.

### Electroplating

Electroplating, specifically electrochemical copper deposition, is used to deposit a thin layer of copper onto the walls of drilled holes, forming conductive pathways between layers.

### Imaging

The imaging process involves transferring the circuit pattern from the photomask onto the photoresist-coated surface of the PCB using UV light exposure and chemical development.

### Etching

Etching is the selective removal of unwanted copper from the PCB surface using chemical etchants, leaving behind the desired circuit traces and patterns.

### Coating

Coating, or surface finishing, involves applying a protective layer onto the exposed copper surfaces of the PCB to improve solderability and prevent oxidation.
